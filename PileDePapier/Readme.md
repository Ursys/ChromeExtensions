Some things I would like to improve:

1) Change so the boarder of the notes field to:
    + always show
    + is the length of the page
2) Add a "save button"
    + will save to a .txt file
    + will use the test from the notes_title ID
    + will clear the save storage after the file is crated
3) underline the notes_title field to distinguish it from the not
4) add some button or hotkeys to change the font, font style, and color
